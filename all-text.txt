Thesis Section
---------------
AI agents will spend billions. x402 makes every HTTP endpoint machine‑payable. USDC on Base. We're building the payment layer for AGI.

The future isn't humans with API keys—it's agents with wallets. Every Claude, GPT, and custom agent will need to pay for services. We've built the first protocol where HTTP 402 meets blockchain settlement. One request → one quote → one payment. Instant, verifiable, on‑chain.

Deploy any service as x402. Agents discover it, quote it, pay for it—no accounts, no OAuth, no credit cards. Just wallets and smart contracts. This is how trillion‑dollar agent economies get built. We're making it standard.

[Agent]
The first AI agent that actually pays. Plans, quotes, and settles in USDC on Base. Understands x402, executes purchases, unlocks premium APIs. This is what autonomous spending looks like.

[Panel]
Turn your API into revenue in minutes. Set prices, deploy x402, watch agents pay. Real‑time analytics, on‑chain receipts, instant USDC settlement. The dashboard for the agent economy.

[x402]
HTTP 402 Payment Required, reimagined for Web3. Server quotes, agent pays in USDC, client retries with proof. The missing protocol that makes agents economically autonomous.

Robotics Use Cases Section
---------------------------
AI agents unlock trillion‑dollar markets. Every capability becomes pay‑per‑use.

Vision APIs agents buy
Agents pay per inference for OCR, object detection, image analysis. No monthly fees. Just USDC per call. The AI vision market, now machine‑accessible.

Real‑time data streams
Market data, social feeds, IoT sensors—all priced per access. Agents compose data sources on demand. Pay only for what they consume.

Human expertise on tap
Agents escalate complex tasks to human specialists. Pay per consultation minute. On‑chain receipts, instant settlement. The gig economy meets AGI.

Premium model access
Deploy gated LLMs, custom fine‑tunes, or specialized models. Agents pay per token or inference. Your models become revenue streams.

Compute marketplaces
Rent GPU cycles, serverless functions, or specialized hardware. Agents pay per job. Idle compute becomes instant revenue. The Airbnb for AI infrastructure.

How It Works Section
--------------------
[ The machine economy ]

[01] Agent requests
AI agent calls your API. Server returns HTTP 402 with a USDC quote on Base. Dynamic pricing. Instant quotes. Zero overhead.

[02] Agent pays
Wallet auto‑approves, settles in USDC. Transaction confirmed on‑chain in seconds. The quote is now a verifiable receipt.

[03] Agent accesses
Client retries with payment proof in X‑PAYMENT header. API unlocks. Agent gets the resource. You get paid. This is the new internet.

Anatomy of Node Section
------------------------
The payment protocol AGI needs.

[ ] Built for AGI scale
Millions of agents, billions of transactions. x402 scales with USDC on Base L2. Sub‑cent fees. Instant finality. This infrastructure is ready for the agent explosion.

[ ] No integration hell
One protocol, every agent. No OAuth, no API keys, no rate limits. Agents use wallets. Your API returns 402. That's it. Standard, simple, unstoppable.

[ ] Verifiable from day one
Every payment is on‑chain. Every quote is signed. Every receipt is provable. Build trust into agent economies by default. No disputes, no chargebacks.

DOCUMENTATION
=============

Overview Page
-------------
From users to AI agents, from AI agents to robots. Enabling machines to operate in an autonomous economy.

Getting Started
---------------
Set up your r1x development environment and start building on the machine economy.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have:
• Node.js 20.9.0 or higher
• npm 10.0.0 or higher
• A Base network wallet (MetaMask recommended)
• USDC on Base mainnet for testing
• A Coinbase Developer Platform account (for PayAI facilitator)

Environment Setup
Create a .env.local file in your project root with the following variables.

PayAI Configuration
For Base mainnet, PayAI facilitator requires Coinbase Developer Platform (CDP) API keys for authentication. Get your keys from portal.cdp.coinbase.com and set them as CDP_API_KEY_ID and CDP_API_KEY_SECRET.

Database Setup
r1x uses Prisma with PostgreSQL. Set up your database.

Installation
Install dependencies and start the development server.

Express Server
The x402 Express server runs separately on Railway and handles payment middleware. Configure NEXT_PUBLIC_X402_SERVER_URL to point to your Railway deployment.

Sync PayAI Services
After deployment, sync services from PayAI facilitator.

Ready to Build
You're all set! Visit Utilities to learn about available tools and Tutorials for step-by-step guides.

r1x Agent Documentation
-----------------------
The first AI agent that actually pays. Built to prove AI agents can be economically autonomous.

What is r1x Agent?
r1x Agent is an AI assistant powered by Claude 3.5 Sonnet that understands x402 payment protocols. When it encounters a paid service, it automatically generates a payment quote, guides you through wallet approval, and retries the request with proof.

This is the proof of concept for the autonomous economy. Every conversation that requires a paid service demonstrates how agents will spend billions in the coming years.

How it Works
[01] Agent detects x402
When a service returns HTTP 402, r1x Agent parses the payment quote, extracts the price, and presents it to you.

[02] Wallet approval
Agent guides you to approve USDC payment on Base network. Transaction settles in seconds with sub‑cent fees.

[03] Auto‑retry with proof
After payment, agent automatically retries the request with payment proof in X‑PAYMENT header. Service unlocks. You get the result.

Try it Now
Live Demo
r1x Agent is live at /r1x-agent. Connect your wallet and chat. Every message costs $0.25 USDC on Base.

Example Interaction
You: "What can you help me with?"
r1x Agent: "I'm an AI assistant that can help with questions, analysis, and tasks. This service costs $0.25 USDC per message on Base network."
[Payment quote appears]
[Wallet approval]
[Payment settles]
r1x Agent: [Continues conversation with full response]

Why This Matters
Agents need to pay. As AI becomes more autonomous, it needs to purchase services independently. API keys don't scale. OAuth doesn't work for machines. Credit cards require humans.

x402 + wallets solve this. Agents use wallets like humans use credit cards. Services return 402 quotes. Agents pay in USDC. On‑chain settlement. Verifiable receipts. This is the missing piece.

r1x Agent is the proof. Every conversation demonstrates autonomous payment. Every transaction shows this works at scale. This is what the trillion‑dollar agent economy will look like.

Marketplace Documentation
-------------------------
The app store for AI agents. Discover, quote, and purchase x402 services on demand.

Overview
r1x Marketplace is where agents find services to buy. Every listing is an x402‑protected API. Every purchase is settled in USDC on Base. Every transaction is verifiable on‑chain.

This is the agent economy's discovery layer. Deploy your service, set your price, watch agents buy. No integration required—just standard x402.

List Your Service
Deploy x402 endpoint
That's it. Your service is now listed. Agents discover it, r1x handles the payment infrastructure.

Facilitator Documentation
-------------------------
The payment verification layer. Trustless, fast, and agent‑optimized. Coming soon.

What is a Facilitator?
Facilitators verify x402 payments and route settlements. They're the trusted third party that confirms "yes, this agent paid" without seeing what was purchased. Think Stripe Connect meets zero‑knowledge proofs.

r1x Facilitator will be optimized for AI agent transactions. Sub‑second verification. Batch settlement. Agent‑specific fraud detection. This is the payment processor agents need.

Why Build Our Own?
Speed. Agents make thousands of micro‑transactions. We're building for sub‑100ms verification. Batch settlements every block. Optimized for high throughput.

Agent‑native. Fraud detection trained on agent behavior patterns. Automatic retry logic. Quote caching. Built for how agents actually transact.

Economics. Lower fees at scale. Revenue sharing with service providers. This becomes profitable when agent spending hits billions.

Current Status
Using PayAI Network
r1x currently uses PayAI facilitator for payment verification. We're building r1x Facilitator to handle agent‑scale economics. Migration will be seamless—same x402 protocol, better performance.

Coming Soon
r1x Facilitator is currently in development. Early adopters will get preferential fee rates. Stay tuned for updates.

r1x Token Documentation
-----------------------
The native token of the r1x ecosystem. Launched on Solana with a deflationary flywheel mechanism powered by platform fees.

What is $R1X?
$R1X is the native token of the r1x ecosystem, launched on Solana. It powers the machine economy through governance, staking, fee discounts, and platform access. As machines transact autonomously, platform fees drive a deflationary flywheel that creates sustainable value for token holders.

The flywheel: More transactions → More fees → More buybacks & burns → Reduced supply → Increased value → More adoption → More transactions. This creates a self-reinforcing cycle that benefits the entire ecosystem.

Tokenomics
Total Supply
1,000,000,000 $R1X
1 billion tokens launched on Pump.fun. Fair launch with no pre-sale or private allocation.

Fee Allocation
75% Buybacks & Burn
Three-quarters of all platform fees are used to buy $R1X tokens from the market and permanently burn them. This creates a deflationary mechanism that reduces supply over time.

Builder Incentives
2% Locked Reserve
2% of the total supply (20 million tokens) will be market-bought and locked for future builder and developer incentives, grants, and ecosystem growth initiatives.

The Flywheel Mechanism
How It Works
1. Machines transact on the r1x platform, generating platform fees with every payment.
2. 75% of fees are automatically allocated to buybacks and burns.
3. Tokens are purchased from the open market and permanently burned, reducing circulating supply.
4. Reduced supply creates upward pressure on token value, benefiting all holders.
5. Increased value attracts more users, builders, and machines to the platform.
6. More adoption generates more transactions and fees, restarting the cycle.

Sustainable Growth
The flywheel creates a self-reinforcing cycle where platform growth directly benefits token holders. As the machine economy scales, so does the deflationary pressure on $R1X supply.

Token Details
NETWORK: Solana
PLATFORM: Pump.fun
SUPPLY: 1B $R1X
BUYBACK & BURN: 75% of fees
BUILDER RESERVE: 2% (20M)
CONTRACT: TBA (Q4 2025)

Token Utility
Governance
Vote on protocol upgrades, fee structures, and new features. Shape the future of the machine economy.

Staking
Stake $R1X to earn rewards and participate in network security. Stakers receive priority access to new features.

Fee Discounts
Holders receive reduced platform fees. The more you hold, the more you save on every transaction.

Platform Access
Unlock premium features, priority support, and exclusive services. Build on top of r1x infrastructure.

Launch Information
$R1X token will launch on Pump.fun in Q4 2025. Stay tuned for the official launch date and contract address. Join our community to be notified when the token goes live.

Robotics Documentation
----------------------
Robotics Vision

Subscriptions don't match robotic workloads. Robots, agents, and APIs buy capability in bursts—per request, per frame, per minute. R1x makes HTTP machine‑payable so autonomy scales without accounts or contracts.

Value happens at the edge and in spikes. Don't rent a month of vision to unlock five seconds of capability. With R1x: one request carries a price, you pay in USDC on Base, you get a verifiable receipt.

Use Cases
→ Per‑frame perception and OCR: Call vision or OCR only when needed; pay cents per frame. No monthly lock‑in.
→ Route planning and HD map tiles per call: Buy HD tiles and routing per segment; purchase navigation data exactly when you need it.
→ Teleop fallback by the minute: Escalate to human control by the minute during edge cases. Pay only when autonomy fails.
→ Sensor data windows (LiDAR/IMU) on demand: Publish or consume LiDAR/IMU windows on demand. Access streams per time window, not per subscription.
→ Charging slot reservations and fleet telemetry access: Reserve slots and settle once confirmed. Pay per use, not per month.

Why Per‑Request Pricing Matters
Robotics workloads are spiky. A delivery robot may need intensive mapping for 30 seconds, then navigate autonomously for hours. A warehouse bot might require OCR for peak sorting windows, then idle.

Traditional subscriptions force you to pay for capacity you rarely use. Per‑request pricing matches reality: pay only for what you consume, when you consume it. Every transaction is verifiable on‑chain for transparent costs.

r1x - The Payment Infrastructure for the Machine Economy

From users to AI agents, from AI agents to robots. Enabling machines to operate in an autonomous economy.

Robots buying from robots. Agents paying agents. Machines transacting autonomously. We're building the payment infrastructure.

What is r1x?
The next economy isn't human. It's autonomous. No accounts. No subscriptions. No dashboards. Just machines buying capabilities per request. One transaction at a time.

Robotics workloads are SPIKY. A delivery bot needs intensive mapping for 30 seconds, then navigates autonomously for hours. Why pay monthly for what you use sporadically?

THE NEW MODEL:
One request = One price = One payment

Pay per frame. Pay per minute. Pay per route. No lock-in. No contracts. Every transaction is verifiable on-chain. Complete transparency.

Core Utilities
1. x402 Payment Protocol
- HTTP 402 Payment Required, reborn for machines
- Quote a price, pay from wallet, retry with proof
- No accounts. No API keys. No humans. Just machines transacting
- Built on Base network with USDC
- Every payment is on-chain. Every transaction is verifiable

2. r1x Agent
- An AI agent that thinks, pays, and accesses the world
- Powered by Claude 3 Opus
- Understands x402 and purchases resources autonomously
- Pay-per-message pricing ($0.25 per message)
- Create resources robots will buy. Build services agents will pay for

3. Marketplace

- Access data streams machines can consume
- Real-time service discovery. Everything priced. Everything payable

4. User & Platform Panels
- Watch the machine economy unfold in real-time
- Monitor every transaction. Track every autonomous purchase
- Create resources that robots will buy
- Set prices that agents will pay
- Complete analytics. Full transparency

5. SDK & APIs
- Build the future of machine commerce
- Express middleware for x402 (x402-server/)
- Public APIs for service discovery

- Everything you need to make your services machine-payable

Robotics Use Cases
Robots compose capabilities like software. Buy perception when uncertain. Purchase routes when lost. Escalate to human control only when needed.

- Buy perception when uncertain: A delivery bot needs intensive mapping for 30 seconds, then navigates autonomously for hours. Pay per frame for vision APIs. Pay per image for OCR. No monthly lock-in
- Purchase routes when lost: Buy HD map tiles per route segment. Pay per minute for navigation. Why pay monthly for what you use sporadically?
- Escalate to human control only when needed: Pay for teleoperation by the minute when autonomy hits edge cases. Machines buying human expertise only when needed. One request at a time
- Robots compose capabilities like software: Publish LiDAR sweeps. Consume sensor data from other robots. Build real-time sensor networks. A bazaar where autonomous services transact directly
- Infrastructure becomes machine-payable: Reserve charging slots per use. Pay for docking bays when docking. The physical world becomes machine-payable. No subscriptions. Just pay for what you use
